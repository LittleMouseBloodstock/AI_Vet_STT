  # Backend URL should ideally be dynamic or stored in secrets if sensitive, 
  # but for now we hardcode the known URL or use a secret if provided.
  # Assuming the user might want to set this via secret or we use the standard format.
  # For safety, we'll try to use a secret, but fallback to manual entry requirement instruction if needed.
  # We will use a secret for cleaner config: API_BASE_URL
